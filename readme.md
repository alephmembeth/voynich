# Beinecke MS 408 (“Cipher Manuscript”)

This is a repository for a transcription of [Beinecke MS 408](https://collections.library.yale.edu/catalog/2002046) (the infamous _Voynich manuscript_). Also, I began adding some fun with statistics.

- The transcript (work in progress based on Takeshi Takahashi’s transliteration) is available in `/transcript`.
- Data can be found in `/analysis`, together with a Jupyter Notebook (version 6.4.8) for analysis with Python (version 3.9.12).
